##### Comments

I will be evaluating my learning experience by writing every new thing I learn each day, this way I can always keep track of what's new.
What I learnt today was a review of what we already took in code 102 plus how to setup a project properly and add different things to it. In addition to learning parseInt, tolowercase, touppercase and switch function.

#### New Features

On lab03 I edited the html file and turned some of the information into lists.
I also added a sixth question that includes guessing a number with alerts indicating if it's higher or lower than the user's input while giving them only 4 chances.
Then I added a seventh question with multiple correct answers and used loops and arrays to make it possible.
And finally the score will be shown to the user.
